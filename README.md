# Project Auth API

This assignment involves creating a backend API with Mongoose for user registration, login, and an authenticated endpoint for logged-in users. The React frontend includes registration and login forms, a page for authenticated content, and a sign-out button that clears the access token from local storage. The API should validate user input, encrypt passwords with bcrypt, and handle unauthorized access with appropriate error messages.

## The problem
We were confused by the instructions. Authentication using tokens was required, but we also implemented authentication using sessions with Passport.js for higher security.
